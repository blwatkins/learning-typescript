`target`
* the version of JavaScript to be generated by the compiler

`rootDir`
* location of source code files
* common location: `./src`

`sourceMap`
* should a source map be generated with the JavaScript code?
* a source map tells how each line of TypeScript code maps to the generated JavaScript code.

`outDir`
* location where the compiled JavaScript files should be placed
* common location: `./dist` (distributable directory)

`removeComments`

`noEmitOnError`
* TypeScript compiler will not generate JavaScript files if it encounters an error

`noImplicitAny`
* Should the compiler throw an error for implicit any declarations?

`strictNullChecks`
* When enabled, null and undefined will not be acceptable values for variables unless you explicitly declare them as nullable.

`noUnusedLocals`
* Should we have error reporting when local variables aren't used?

`noUnusedParameters`
* Should we raise an error when a function parameter isn't used?

`noImplicitReturns`
* Should we have error reporting for codepaths that do not explicitly return in a function?

`noImplicitOverride`
* Should we have error reporting when overriding members are NOT marked with an override modifier?
