# Generic TypeScript Notes

## TypeScript Benefits

* type checking with variables and functions
* can be used wherever JavaScript is used

## TypeScript Drawbacks

* required compilation step
  * transpilation: translating TypeScript to JavaScript so it can be interpreted and executed by a web browser

## TypeScript is a statically typed language

* The type of variables is determined at compile time
* The type of a variable cannot change
